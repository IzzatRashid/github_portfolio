This case study is from Google Data Analytic Certificate Course.\n\n**Scenario**\nYou are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of\nmarketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your\nteam wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will\ndesign a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your\nrecommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n\n**Business Task**\nCurrently there are three question that will provide as our guide:\n1. How do annual members and casual riders differ in their use of Cyclistic bikes?\n2. Why would infrequent riders purchase Cyclistic yearly memberships?\n3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to persuade casual riders to join?\n\nMy supervisor assigned me to find out how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.\n\n**Preparation**\nThe data source that is being used is a Verified bike share information made accessible to the public by Motivate International Inc.\nSpreadsheets are used to store the data. Through entirety, there are only 1 .Csv files that are being used. \nFor education purpose I purposely run the analysis by using one quarter of year ranging from 1 January 2015 to 31 March 2015 as this is my first case study. \nThe data can be find [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The dataset contain 12 columns: \ntrip_id , starttime , stoptime , bikeid , tripduration , from_station_id , from_station_name , to_station_id , to_station_name , usertype , gender and birthyear\nRegarding bias and reliability, the data sets is original and trustworthy as this is a public data which is accurate, complete and unbiased data. \nThis data is also cited and can be found in publicly as it is a govermental agency data.\n\n**Process**\n\n**Data Cleaning and manipulation**\n-Using Spreadsheet for initial data cleaning and manipulation\nThe data is download and save as .CSV and save in a secure folder. Then the data is copied to a subfolder so I can keep the raw data.\nAfter that I began to examining the data and did the following action:\n\n1. Set the column from_station_name and end_station_name format as DATETIME \n\n2.  Create a new column ride_length:\n     -Calculate each ride length duration by Subtracting starttime from endtime (example: =B3-B1)\n     -The row is format as TIME (HH:MM:SS)\n\n3.  Create a column weekday:\n       -Calculated the day of the week that each ride started using the WEEKDAY command (example: =WEEKDAY(C2,1))\n       -The column is format as INTEGER\n\n5. 4.  Create a column day_of_week\n        -Transform the number that represent the days in weekday into the days using the SWITCH command\n         (example: =SWITCH(A6,1,\"Sunday\",2,\"Monday\",...)\n        -The column is format as STRING  \n After making all these update I save the data as CSV. file then proceed to further analysis with Bigquery\n \n**Using BigQuery for further data cleaning and manipulation**\nGiven the size of these datasets, it seems appropriate to transfer our study to a program designed with handling huge datasets in mind.\nI decided to use BigQuery with SQL. I proceeded to create a BigQuery project and uploaded these files as datasets.\nThen I used DISTINCT to start cleaning the data by looking for misspellings and abnormalities in the columns that included strings.\n          \nSELECT DISTINCT [string column]\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.q1_cyclistic_2015`\n\nI found no misspeling or other issues\nThen I proceed to check for duplicate rows\n          \nSELECT\n  COUNT(trip_id)\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.q1_cyclistic_2015` \nWHERE trip_id >

value on trip_id as trip_id is the primary key in this dataset\n          \nSELECT\n  CAST(trip_id as STRING) tripid,\n  bikeid,\n  starttime,\n  stoptime,\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.q1_cyclistic_2015`\nWHERE trip_id IS

of trip and total trip by usertype\n\n**Total no. of trip**          \nSELECT \n  COUNT(trip_id) AS total_ride,\n  (\n    SELECT \n      COUNT(trip_id) \n      FROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_CYCLISTIC_2015`\n      WHERE usertype = 'Customer'\n  ) AS total_casual,\n  (SELECT\n    COUNT(trip_id) AS total_subscriber\n    FROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_CYCLISTIC_2015`\n    WHERE usertype= 'Subscriber'\n  ) AS total_subscriber\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_CYCLISTIC_2015`\n\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/3d7e9998-8e16-41b1-a819-0784efa9e3eb)\n\n        \nThe result shows that total trip is 202325, Member = 177834, Casual = 24491\n          \n**Average ride**\nLets see how the average length for the ride_length\n\nSELECT\n(\n  SELECT\n  TIME(TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(CAST(avg(DATETIME_DIFF(stoptime,starttime,SECOND)) as INT64))) ,\n  FROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.q1_cyclistic_2015`\n) as avg_time_total,\n(\n  SELECT\n

usertype = 'Customer'\n) as avg_time_customer,\n\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/f5e9ee7b-3fad-41f2-a8c5-b6112b3a94e4)\n\n\nThe result shown that the total average ride is 13:06, Member  is 11:04, Casual is 27:46\nFrom what we have it is shown that the no of trip for Member is far surpassed Casual but Casual average ride is higher than Member .\nLets check the MAX trip_length by both usertype for further confirmation\n\n**Max ride_length**\n          \nSELECT\nusertype,\nMAX(ride_length) AS ride_length\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_CYCLISTIC_2015`\nGROUP BY usertype \n\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/890dc326-efb1-431b-9c47-146db298ae10)\n\n          \nThe result shown that the MAX ride_length Member is 23:46:00, Casual is 23:50:00.\nAlthough the ride max ride length of Member is less than Casual it not vary by much.\nFor more accurate analysis lets check the median ride_length for each usertype\n          \n SELECT\n  DISTINCT median_ride_length,\n  usertype\nFROM\n(SELECT\n   trip_id,\n   usertype,\n   ride_length, \n   PERCENTILE_DISC(ride_length, 0.5 IGNORE NULLS) OVER(PARTITION BY usertype) AS  median_ride_length\n   FROM \n   `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_CYCLISTIC_2015`\n)\nORDER BY median_ride_length DESC\n\n        \n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/f9d1b2ae-ff2a-431d-9543-2cb0134b1e40)\n\n  \nThe median ride length for Casual is 20:00 , Member is 08:00\nFrom here we can see that the ride_length median for Member is much lower than Casual .\nNext, lets check for the busiest day for both user         \n          \n**No. of trip per day**\n          \nSELECT\nCOUNT(trip_id)AS no_of_trip,\nday_of_week\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_CYCLISTIC_2015` \nGROUP BY day_of_week\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/42f4ed67-226a-4c7b-b298-c06afa66b04f)\n\nContradict to our expectation the number of ride is much more on weekday than weekend.\nNow how which day is the busiest day for both the Member and Casual:\n\n\n**No. of Member trip per day**\n\nSELECT\nno_of_trip,\nday_of_week\nFROM\nnew_table\nWHERE usertype = \"Subscriber\"\nGROUP BY new_table.no_of_trip, day_of_we\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/778ebb5e-814c-4825-96d1-0e189042b3b5)\n\n\n**No. of Casual trip per day**\n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(trip_id) AS no_of_customer_trip,\nday_of_week\nFROM\n`corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_CYCLISTIC_2015`\nWHERE usertype = \"Customer\"\nGROUP BY day_of_week\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/57372c39-ad92-498e-ae70-c76b19e19916)\n\nThe numbers of ride by Casual member is highest during weekend while Member member is during weekdays\nNext lets see the average ride length per day\n\n**Average ride length per day**\n\nSELECT\nday_of_week,\nTIME(TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(CAST(avg(DATETIME_DIFF(stoptime,starttime,second)) as INT64))) AS avg_time\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_CYCLISTIC_2015` \nGROUP BY day_of_week\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/c6170ca7-58e7-4095-b38b-5f7101da1fcf)\n\n\nFrom the result we can see that although the number of trip in weekdays is much larger than weekend, the average ride for weekend is significantly higher than weekdays. Now lets see how it differ for both user\n\n**Average Member ride length per day**\n\nSELECT\nday_of_week,\nTIME(TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(CAST(avg(DATETIME_DIFF(stoptime,starttime,second)) as INT64))) AS avg_time\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_CYCLISTIC_2015` \nWHERE usertype = \"Subscriber\"\nGROUP BY day_of_week\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/ede64e26-38f2-4b96-adb6-eae69f9867d9)\n\n**Average Casual ride length per day**\n\nSELECT\nday_of_week,\nTIME(TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(CAST(avg(DATETIME_DIFF(stoptime,starttime,second)) as INT64))) AS avg_time\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_CYCLISTIC_2015` \nWHERE usertype = \"Customer\"\nGROUP BY day_of_week\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/25e8761d-f5cb-4eea-8d62-a3d351647bd7)\n\nAverage ride taken by Casual user is significantly higher than Member user. The longest average ride for both Users is On Saturday.\nFurthermore we can take a look at the users busiest time per day for further comparison.\n\n**Average Casual ride length per hour**\n\nSELECT\nday_of_week,\nCOUNT(*) AS no_of_rides,\nEXTRACT(HOUR from starttime) AS hour\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_CYCLISTIC_2015` \nWHERE usertype = \"Customer\"\nGROUP BY day_of_week,hour\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/7b351080-238b-4b6e-984c-1abad99c1c58)\n\n**Average Member ride length per hour**\n\nSELECT\nday_of_week,\nCOUNT(*) AS no_of_rides,\nEXTRACT(HOUR from starttime) AS hour\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_CYCLISTIC_2015` \nWHERE usertype = \"Subscriber\"\nGROUP BY day_of_week,hour\n\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/49cc6b43-d772-412b-9cf2-82f8e7a3bb42)\n\nFrom the result we can see that the peak number of rides or Member is at 08:00 and at 17:00. On the other hand, number of rides for Casual user is peak at 14:00.\nNow, we can try to look at it from different perspective by analyzing which is the most popular station for both users.\nStart with finding the Casual top 10 start station and end station.\n\n**Top 10 Casual End Station**\n\nSELECT\nto_station_name,\nCOUNT(*) AS no_of_trip\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_2015_cyclistic`\nWHERE usertype = \"Customer\" \nGROUP BY to_station_name\nORDER BY no_of_trip DESC\nLIMIT 10\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/7ffb7a2e-0dd0-4e61-af8b-c363e0102ce2)\n\n**Top 10 Casual Start Station**\n\nSELECT\nfrom_station_name,\nCOUNT(*) AS no_of_trip\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_2015_cyclistic` \nWHERE usertype = \"Customer\"\nGROUP BY from_station_name\nORDER BY no_of_trip DESC\nLIMIT 10\n\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/c7a825f7-403b-45bd-9c99-b5e7e2caba82)\n\n**Top 10 Member End Station**\n\nSELECT\nto_station_name,\nCOUNT(*) AS no_of_trip\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_2015_cyclistic`\nWHERE usertype = \"Subscriber\" \nGROUP BY to_station_name\nORDER BY no_of_trip DESC\nLIMIT 10\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/cf2fab5e-91d2-4d89-9a65-d48e2187fa4d)\n\n\n**Top 10 Member Start Station**\n\nSELECT\nfrom_station_name,\nCOUNT(*) AS no_of_trip\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.Q1_2015_cyclistic` \nWHERE usertype = \"Subscriber\"\nGROUP BY from_station_name\nORDER BY no_of_trip DESC\nLIMIT 10\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/5153baa9-63fb-43c0-95d9-54eb5fa6c4fd)\n\nPlease keep in mind that I stored each query result as a new table so that I could join them to get a total count of how many times members and casual riders started or concluded at each station.\nNow we can proceed to finding top 10 popular station by each users.\n\n**Top Total 10 Casual Station**\n\nSELECT\nstart_station AS station_names,\n`corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.customer_end_station`.no_of_trip + `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.customer_start_station`.no_of_trip AS total_customer_visit\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.customer_start_station`\n  JOIN `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.customer_end_station`\n  ON start_station = end_station\nLIMIT 10\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/4b9b879c-761f-4cd8-bbf2-a96d2ee9408f)\n\n**Top Total 10 Casual Station**\n\nSELECT\nstart_station AS station_names,\n`corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.subscriber_end_station`.no_of_trip + `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.subscriber_end_station`.no_of_trip AS total_subscriber_visit\nFROM `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.subscriber_start_station`\n  JOIN `corded-palisade-399911.Cyclistic_bike.subscriber_end_station`\n  ON start_station = end_station\n  LIMIT 10\n\n\n![Image](https://github.com/users/IzzatRashid/projects/1/assets/149081597/cdd64f2e-716d-4fe7-8a7e-fa124cc441d4)\n\n**Share**\nFor the Visualisation I have done it on Tableau, I will share the [LINK HERE](https://public.tableau.com/shared/KWK28PBYG?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)\n\n_**Casual Vs. Member**_\n\nThroughout 1st January 2015 to 31th March 2015 total ride by both user is 202325. 88% is from the Member with a total of 177834, while Casual member is 12% with 24491 in total. As we can see the number of Member rider is much more higher than Casual rider. While that is true upon inspecting further the average ride length for users it shows that average ride length for Casual member is much higher than the Member. Average time or Casual is a whooping 27:46 minutes while Member is 11:04minutes.\n Due to significant margin between users average ride length I decided to further analyze this as there's a possibility that the average is affected by other factor. For further accurate result I go on with the median for each users as it will help with the analyzing. The median for Casual user is 20:00 minutes and 8:00 minutes for Member. \n\n_**Days**_\nNext I proceed with analyzing the users by days. To check busiest day for each user I calculate the total number of trip of each user by days and interestingly the number of trip by Member is peak on weekday while Casual member is on Weekend. From here i made an initial hypothesis that the Member is a working person on standard working hour and use the the ride for work purposes, while the Casual user is the opposite of that or someone that don't need bicycle to go to work. \n\nUpon that I decided to proceed with finding the number of trip for each users by hour to prove the hypothesis. The result has shown that the busiest time for Member users peak significantly at 8:00 am and 17:00 pm. While the Casual user is at 14:00 pm and 15:00 pm but the number of rides is spread much more that Member. From this it has been prove the hypothesis made earlier.\n\n_**Location**_\nFinally, I start to analyze the most popular station by each users. Upon inspecting is shows that the majority of Casual user prefer to ride side of the lake. Contrary to that the Member user tend to be more populated to the east  side, which packed stacking upon each other in the center of town. \n\n\n**Act**\nConclusion, there a a significant difference between Member and Casual riders:\n\n1. The average time for Casual is more than double of Member\n2. During weekdays the number of ride by Member user peaked especially at 8:00 am and 17:00 pm\n3. The number of rides on weekend is solely from Casual member \n4. Casual member have a tendency to ride along side the lake\n\nThe goal of the company is to covert the Casual rider to Member, Cyclistic should utilize ride data generated to provide targeted marketing to riders who meet certain criteria from above conclusion. As the average time for Member rider is much shorter than Casual member , the company can make an event which encourage the member use it much more often to anywhere. As an example, make an application that calculate the ride distance covered by each riders and or each certain ride the can claim a certain prize such as umbrella, bicycle light, flag or any other depending on the distance covered in certain time line. \n\nNext, as the number of member rider is peaked during commute hour while the Casual rider is on weekend. Cyclistic should made a different package promotion that suit both the needs of both rider. As an example, a voucher package where for each time or day the rider go on for a ride for certain distance or time they can claim a voucher or discount for any movies, restaurant, drinks and others. For member, it will be making a designated package for users that use the bike for commuting to work. As an example, for every time they use the bike at certain location at certain time they get a membership discount or an extended membership voucher. \n\nDue to the the tendency of Casual member to ride along the lake side, we should focus on making a promotion alongside the lake. As an example make a banner or a renting a board along side the lake that provide the benefit of Membership and can included the packaged mention before to further peak their interest. Making an phone app is much more benificial that a website as it user friendly for all people and easier to access by using Qr Code.\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
